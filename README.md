## 🧵 **Problem Statement:**
**ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange**

> Develop ReWear, a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing  
> through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system.  
> The goal is to promote sustainable fashion 🌱 and reduce textile waste by encouraging  
> users to reuse wearable garments instead of discarding them.
